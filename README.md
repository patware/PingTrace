# PingTrace
Created Repo for PoC Ping and Trace

This Proof of Concept is used to showcase the Ping and Trace pattern seen in Windows, Linux, etc. but into a "custom" application

Ping: returns the text "Pong".  Super simple and stupid return, but prooves that the application is installed and configured correctly.
Trace: calls a destination and times the results.  Includes a message/payload for validation.
Traces: lists the known destinations and expected results.
